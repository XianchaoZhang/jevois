Below are alternative approaches.

\section userstartmac Getting started with Mac - basic PhotoBooth

The JeVois smart camera is used like a regular USB camera. To get started with a Mac host computer:

<ul>
<li>Download a disk image from http://jevois.org and flash it to a MicroSD card.

<li>Insert MicroSD card into JeVois smart camera, with the MicroSD contacts pointing up as shown below.

\jvimg{microsd-fully-inserted.jpg, 60%}

<li>Connect camera to a host computer. The smart camera requires up to 3.5 Watts of power, which is above the limit of
what a single USB 2.0 port is designed to supply, but is within the limits of a single USB 3.0 port. It is important to
use a high-quality USB-to-miniUSB cable that can carry that full power without loss. Look for a cable with 24awg power
wires. It is recommended that you use a USB 3.0 port on your host computer, as those provide more power. If that is not
available, you can use a USB Y-cable to connect to two USB 2.0 ports on your host computer, or to one USB 2.0 port and
one external USB power supply (e.g., phone charger). Make sure that you do not use a USB hub, unless that hub has a
strong external power supply (transformer, wall adapter).

<li>Observe the LED on the smart camera next to the USB connector:
  - Green: Power is on and is strong enough.
  - After about 3 seconds: Flash orange: The camera sensor chip has been detected and initialized.
  - After about 5 seconds: Solid orange: The smart camera is ready for use.
  - Wait a few more seconds for your host computer to detect the camera and prepare itself for video capture.

<li>Start a video capture software. Here we will use the bundled-in PhotoBooth app that is in your Applications
directory.

Launch PhotoBooth from your Applications folder. You should see this:

Photobooth does not give you access to contrast, exposure, etc controls. But you can get third-party apps from the App
Store to do that. Here is for example using Webcam Settings after getting it from the App Store (free):

\image html mac-webcam-settings.png

You can also try VLC, Skype, Facetime, etc. The built-in Photobooth app is very picky and will refuse to use the camera
if the camera exposes BAYER or RGB565 video modes, too many modes, etc. It also does not allow you to select video
resolution. To use the JeVois camera on a mac it is recommended that you configure it with only one available video
resolution (one entry in your \c videomappings.cfg file). See UserModes for more info.

\section obsmac  Getting started with Mac - Open Broadcaster Studio

Open Broadcaster Studio is a great free program that allows you to select different video resolutions, as needed by
JeVois.

- Download OBS Studio from https://obsproject.com

- Install it, during installation, just say that you will not be streaming video.

- Connect JeVois to your computer and allow it to start up.

- Open OBS Studio, towards the bottom left of the screen, click the `+` icon under \b Sources to add a new <b>video
  capture device</b>.
  \image html mobs1.png

- Create a new source
  \image html mobs2.png

- Select the Jevois-A33 Smart camera as its device, uncheck <b>Use Preset</b> to enable all JeVois resolutions, pick a
  resolution that you want to try out, select <b>Simple FPS Values</b>, and pick one of the available FPS values.

- When you double-click on that source, a dialog comes up. In there, you can select:
  + Device: JeVois-A33 Smart Camera
  + Make sure you keep <b>Use preset</b> unchecked
  + Resolution: pick any that you want to try out
  + FPS: when you change resolution, sometimes you will be offered some <b>Rational FPS values</b>, but it is simpler to
    just switch back to <b>Simple FPS values</b> and pick one that JeVois is offering.

- Enjoy! You can drag and resize the video preview for best viewing experience.

\section userstartmaccamtwist Getting started with Mac - CamTwist Studio

Selection of different machine vision algorithms is achieved by selecting different video resolutions in your video
capture software. On Macs, most webcam apps do not allow you to select video resolution. But a few do. One example is
CamTwist Studio.

To make it work:

<ul>

<li>Download [CamTwist Studio](http://camtwiststudio.com/download/). We used the latest (development) version and
it worked great on our El Capitan Mac.

<li>Install it on your Mac.

<li>Plug in your JeVois camera, wait for orange LED flash and then solid orange LED.

<li>Launch CamTwist Studio.

<li>In the CamTwist window, double-click on \c Webcam under 'Step 1: Select a video source'.

<li>Then under \c Settings at the right of the CamTwist window, select the 'JeVois A33 Smart Camera'.

\image html camtwist-setcam.png

<li>On the menu bar at the top of the screen, select \c View \c -> \c Preview. This should show live video from your
JeVois smart camera. The frame rate is not great, but that will be fixed below.By default, the resolution is 320x240 in
MJPEG with no processing on the JeVois smart camera (i.e., it behaves like a regular camera).

\image html camtwist-prefs.png

<li>On the menu bar at the top of the screen, go to \c CamTwist \c -> \c Preferences. Click on 'Video Devices' towards
the top of the preferences window. Then select the JeVois-A33 Smart Camera. Finally, use the \c Format pull-down menu to
select various resolutions. Each time you select a new resolution, it will also select a different machine vision
algorithm on your smart camera. See [JeVois Start, under 'Demos'](http://jevois.org/start/start.html#demos-section) for
a list of the default video mappings (which algorithm runs on JeVois depending on which resolution you select in
CamTwist).

<li>Under \c General in the \c Preferences window, you can change frame rate and resolution of the preview box. You need
to restart CamTwist after the change. You will also need to manually drag the corner of the preview window to its full
new size.

<li>Make sure you quit your camera viewing software before you unplug your JeVois smart camera. Otherwise your host
computer may become awfully confused trying to use a camera that does not exist anymore.

<li>No shutdown procedure is needed before powering off your JeVois camera. Just close your video capture software and
unplug the camera.

</ul>

\section userstartmacother Getting started with Mac - ffplay

Download the pre-compiled ffplay binary from the ffmpeg web site at https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-mac (it is
free), and then open a Terminal (in Applications, under Utilities) and run:

\verbatim
~/bin/ffplay -f avfoundation -i "JeVois" -video_size 640x300 -framerate 60 -pixel_format yuyv422
\endverbatim
(assuming you saved ffplay into your ~/bin/ directory).

Note that on Mac, the latency (delay or lag between capture and display) is horrible with many video capture apps,
including ffplay. This is not a limitation of JeVois. When used with a Linux host, there is no lag.
