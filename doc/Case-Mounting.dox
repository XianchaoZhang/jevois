/*! \page CaseMounting JeVois-A33 case mounting guidelines

The JeVois smart camera provides 4 holes for secure mounting onto a robot or other.

\warning The holes are not threaded at the factory. When you thread screws into them, the plastic of the case will be
formed into a thread by your screws. It is advised that you only mount your JeVois smart camera with screws once. Doing
it several times may wear off the plastic of the holes in the camera case and may result in loose screws.

\warning Hole depth in the JeVois camera case is a bit over 5mm. Plan for maximum 5mm screw length to avoid hitting
the bottom of the screw holes in the case.
